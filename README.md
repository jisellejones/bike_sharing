## Results
Bike Sharing in New York City has been a BIG success, but can bike sharing business also be successful in Des Moines, Iowa? The map shows where riders start their bike trips on and around the island of Manhattan (Image 1). Upon first glance, it looks as though most bike trips begin in a high tourist area of Manhattan.

While there are some tourist attractions in Manhattan, there are far fewer tourists in Des Moines than in Manhattan. So, who are the people riding these bikes? We can see from the pie chart (Image 2) that most riders are subscribers of the bike sharing app. We can speculate that most of the subscribers are local to the area since this bike share business has this one location. Let's dive further into the data to see if we can find out more about the "subscribers".

Looking at the following heat maps (Images 3 & 4), Local bike riders may also be people commuting to and from work as can be seen by the high volumes of ride times during the morning and afternoon commuting hours. These data hold true across the two binary genders as well. We do not have enough data to determine ride sharing counts for non-binary or trans bike riders.
